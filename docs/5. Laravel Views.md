# Laravel Views

## 1. Creating and Managing Views in Laravel
Views in Laravel are responsible for rendering the HTML output of your application.

- **Creating a View**:
  - Views are stored in the `resources/views` directory.
  - Create a new Blade file with a `.blade.php` extension:
    ```php
    <!-- resources/views/welcome.blade.php -->
    <h1>Welcome to Laravel</h1>
    ```

- **Returning a View**:
  - Use the `view()` function in routes or controllers to return a view:
    ```php
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('welcome');
    });
    ```

- **Organizing Views**:
  - Group views in subdirectories for better structure:
    ```php
    <!-- resources/views/auth/login.blade.php -->
    <h1>Login</h1>
    ```
  - Access subdirectory views using dot notation:
    ```php
    return view('auth.login');
    ```

## 2. Passing Data from Controllers to Views
Controllers can pass dynamic data to views using the `view()` function.

- **Passing Data**:
  - Pass an associative array as the second parameter of the `view()` function:
    ```php
    return view('welcome', ['name' => 'John Doe']);
    ```
  - Access the data in the Blade template:
    ```php
    <h1>Welcome, {{ $name }}</h1>
    ```

- **Using Compact**:
  - Use the `compact()` function to pass multiple variables:
    ```php
    return view('dashboard', compact('user', 'posts'));
    ```
  - This is equivalent to:
    ```php
    return view('dashboard', ['user' => $user, 'posts' => $posts]);
    ```

## 3. Sharing Data Across Multiple Views
Laravel provides methods to share data across multiple views without passing it explicitly every time.

- **Using `View::share()`**:
  - Define shared data in a service provider (e.g., `AppServiceProvider`):
    ```php
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

    public function boot()
    {
        View::share('appName', 'Laravel Example App');
    }
    ```
  - Access the shared data in any view:
    ```php
    <h1>Welcome to {{ $appName }}</h1>
    ```

- **Using `view()->composer()`**:
  - Bind data to specific views in a service provider:
    ```php
    view()->composer('partials.navbar', function ($view) {
        $view->with('pageTitle', 'Welcome');
    });
    ```
  - This ensures the `pageTitle` variable is available only in the `partials.navbar` view.

---

## 4. Utilizing View Composers for Modular Data Sharing
View composers allow you to bind logic or data to specific views.

- **Defining a View Composer**:
  - Create a view composer file by `artisan command`
    ```bash
    php artisan make:class Http/View/Composers/WelcomeComposer
    ```
  - You can also create that file manually
  - Create a view composer class:
    ```php
    namespace App\Http\View\Composers;

    use Illuminate\View\View;
    use App\Models\User;

    class WelcomeComposer
    {
        public function compose(View $view)
        {
            $view->with('pageSubTitle', 'Welcome to Laravel Example App');
        }
    }
    ```

- **Registering a View Composer**:
  - Register the composer in the `boot` method of a service provider (e.g., `AppServiceProvider`):
    ```php
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;
    use App\Http\View\Composers\WelcomeComposer;

    public function boot()
    {
        View::composer('partials.navbar', WelcomeComposer::class);
    }
    ```

- **Using the Composer**:
  - The `pageSubTitle` variable will now be automatically available in the `partials.navbar` view:

- **Attaching Multiple Views**:
  - You can attach a composer to multiple views:
    ```php
    View::composer(['partials.navbar', 'profile'], WelcomeComposer::class);
    ```

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively create dynamic views, manage data flow, and improve the modularity of your Laravel applications.

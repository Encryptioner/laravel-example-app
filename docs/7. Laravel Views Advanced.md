# Laravel Views Advanced (With Vue)


## Start new project

### After installing composer and laravel one can start a new project from command line by running

```bash
laravel new laravel-example-app
```

- It will show options to select starter kit.
 |   ○ No starter kit
 │   ○ Laravel Breeze
 │   ○ Laravel Jetstream

- For simplicity use `Laravel Breeze`

- Then you will be asked to select Breeze stack for installation.
 │ › ○ Blade with Alpine
 │   ○ Livewire (Volt Class API) with Alpine
 │   ○ Livewire (Volt Functional API) with Alpine
 │   ○ React with Inertia
 │   ● Vue with Inertia

- There are other frontend library/framework which gives more robust developer experience. PHP supports `Blade template` by default. But we can use modern [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library like [React](https://react.dev/) or [vue](https://vuejs.org/).

- [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) bridges the gap between your Laravel application and your modern Vue or React frontend

- `Vue` has more easier learning curve and can be used in most web development scenario. So, please select `Vue with Inertia`

- You will be asked to choose if you want [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support or not. Allow `typescript support`. `typescript` is a compile time support for `javascript`. TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

- Next, you have to select if you want to have dark mode support. To keep it simple, select `No`
  
- Then you will be asked: `Which testing framework do you prefer?`
 │   ○ Pest
 │   ○ PHPUnit

- `Pest` is more modern than `PHPUnit` which uses test using functional approach instead of class based approach. Select it for now.

- Next, you will be asked to select database. `MySQL` is most commonly used database for laravel project. Select it.
- Your project will be created after all the dependency is installed.

### Then go to the project root folder
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

### Create/Update `.env` file
- Please copy the `.env.example` file and create a new file named `.env`. `.env` file contains all configuration information of your project. Update the `.env` file wherever necessary.

### Setup database
- If you are getting error like `SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused`, then please make sure your mysql database is running
- If you are getting error like `SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using pas...`, then please update your `DB_PASSWORD` field of `.env` file with your root password
- Now run following command
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
- It will ask to create a database matching with your project name. Then it will create tables defined in `database/migrations` directory which is added in starter kit.

### NOTE:
`artisan` is the command line utility of Laravel. It comes integrated with your `laravel` installation.

### Run Project
- Your project is now ready. Run below command to check
```bash
php artisan serve
```
- It will run your project at http://127.0.0.1:8000
